A plugin that allows you to install the tracking code of various Stats programs in one place, and prevent them from tracking the admin user.

== Description ==

The "Generic Stats" plugin is a place for you to put all statistics tracking code that the various stats packages provide in one place.

The benefit is that when swapping templates or adding (and removing) stats code, you don't need to edit your theme.

You also have the option to specify which code will be put above the &lt;body&gt; tag, and which code will be placed BELOW the &lt;/body&gt; tag.

You can also prevent the stats code from being shown to admin users, to prevent the tracking of admin users.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `genstats.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the "Generic Stats" plugin options page
4. Add your statistics code in the appropriate places and click "Update Settings"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get the Statistics Code you talk about? =

When you sign up for a statistics program, for example with [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) or [performancing Metrics](http://pmetrics.performancing.com/480), you are generally given code that you will need to place on your web page. That is the code I am talking about.
